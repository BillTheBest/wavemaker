1. background-image
2. Advanced nonvisual components

MOBILE PHILOSOPHY: 
1. We are not building dedicated mobile apps; we are building scalable apps
1a. This means there are no mobile widgets, only adaptable layouts
1b. While there may be mobile stylesheets, a button that is 20px high, remains 20px high in a touch environment; developer must chose defaults that will work in both touch and click environments.
2. We are achieving scalable apps using a variant of "Responsive Design" http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/12/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/
2a. While we don't scale images for the user at this time, images can be adjusted using ${app.deviceSize} > 1000 ? "image1.png" : "image2.png"

MOBILE TODO:
1. Fluid layout: Drag and drop support
4. Build sample app
5. Build mobile template
8. Touch friendly checkbox/radio
9. Handling of mobileHeight in short containers
