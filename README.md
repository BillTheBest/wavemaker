INSTRUCTIONS
============

Cloning
--------
Due to the use of submodules, cloning should be with --recursive, e.g.
`git clone --recursive https://github.comSpringSource/wavemaker.git`
Otherwise `wavemaker/dev/studio/src/main/webapp/app/lib/ace` will be missing.


Building
--------
In order to build WaveMaker you will need the following applications:

* Java JDK 6 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
* Apache Maven 3.x (http://maven.apache.org/)

To build the complete WaveMaker distribution run the maven from the root directory:

<pre>
    mvn clean install
</pre>
  
To build only WaveMaker studio and required libraries:

<pre>
    cd wavemaker
    mvn clean install
</pre>  
  
Dojo Build
----------
Use the DojoBuild profile to build the gzip version of the libraries. This will enable you to run without ?debug

<pre>
    mvn -PDojoBuild clean install
</pre>

Installer Builds
----------------
The installer package built will be dependent on your operating system.  The following operating systems are currently supported:

* Mac OSX
* Linux (Centos or Ubuntu)
* Windows

Building the windows installer requires zip file of the jdk to be redistributed be available. This zip file can not be in the public repository and must be provided.
Set BUILD_JDK_ZIP to the folder containing the zip file.
e.g. set BUILD_JDK_ZIP=c:\downloads

Importing into Eclipse/STS
--------------------------
To develop WaveMaker using Eclipse or STS run the following from the root directory:

<pre>
    mvn eclipse:eclipse
</pre>

From Eclipse choose File, Import Existing Projects to load projects into eclipse.

WaveMaker studio can be deployed using Eclipse Webtools to an Apache Tomcat 6 installation. 


Inplace Deployment
------------------
If you are primarily working on the JavaScript aspects of WaveMaker you might want to use inplace deployment. Inplace deployment allows changes to be immediately updated in the deployed application.

To use live deployment follow these steps:
Download and install Apache Tomcat 6 from http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi

Enable the manager application by editing /conf/tomcat-users.xml and adding the following:
<pre>
    &lt;tomcat-users$gt;
      &lt;role rolename="manager"/$gt;
      &lt;user username="manager" password="manager" roles="manager"/$gt;
    &lt;/tomcat-users$gt;
</pre>

Build and deploy the project using Maven:

<pre>
    cd wavemaker
    mvn clean install
    cd wavemaker-studio
    mvn -PInplace resources:resources war:inplace tomcat:inplace
</pre>

Use the deployed application http://localhost:8080/wavemaker/?debug
