WM Applications Client Build Process:

The client build process uses an ant script studio/build-js.xml that makes use of the Dojo build system. Build profiles must currently be *manually constructed* and exist at webapproot/app/buildUtil/profiles. There is one profile for studio and one for runtime.

All client library code should be included in the runtime build. The build will produce one compressed file for Dojo (dojo_build.js) and one for the client library (lib_build.js).

Client build resources output to webapproot/lib/build. However, dojo_build.js is placed at webapproot/lib/dojo/dojo/dojo_build.js so that the Dojo path info is consistent for build and debug environments.

Studio has special build requirements and outputs to webapproot/build. Currently we depend on being able to read uncompressed argument names from library code for creating client event code. Therefore the build is broken into a few files and the build which contains widget code avoids variable compression.
