These scripts apply and update licensing to the various portions of the studio
and runtime.  The last time I ran this, the commands looked like this (and I've
noted where I had to do post-run fixups).

Note that the scripts may screw up if the eol-style isn't native.




For the Java server runtime:

> ./license-asl-server.py ../dev/core/
> svn revert ../dev/core/runtime/src/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/JsonView.java
> svn revert ../dev/core/runtime/lib/jaxb-ri-2.1.9/src/com/sun/tools/xjc/api/impl/s2j/SchemaCompilerImpl.java
> svn revert ../dev/core/tools/test/com/wavemaker/tools/project/pages/expectedMain/expectedMain.widgets.js
> svn revert ../dev/core/tools/test/com/wavemaker/tools/project/pages/expectedMain/expectedMain.js
> svn revert ../dev/core/tools/test/com/wavemaker/tools/project/pages/Main/Main.js
> svn revert ../dev/core/tools/test/com/wavemaker/tools/project/pages/Main/Main.widgets.js
> svn revert ../dev/core/tools/test/com/wavemaker/tools/project/upgrade/swamis/currencyrename.widgets.js





For the JS client runtime:

> ./license-asl-client.py ../dev/studio/webapproot/lib/boot ../dev/studio/webapproot/lib/wm
> svn revert ../dev/studio/webapproot/lib/wm/base/widget/ext/GridView.js
> svn revert ../dev/studio/webapproot/lib/wm/base/widget/ext/GroupingView.js

manually update ../dev/studio/webapproot/lib/{manifest,runtimeLoader}.js





For the studio:

> ./license-agpl-studio.py ../dev/studio/services/ ../dev/studio/webapproot/pages/ ../dev/studio/webapproot/app
> svn revert -R ../dev/studio/webapproot/app/buildUtil
> svn revert -R ../dev/studio/webapproot/app/edit_area
> svn revert -R ../dev/studio/webapproot/app/templates
