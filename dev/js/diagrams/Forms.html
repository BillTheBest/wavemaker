	<p>
		Data objects on palette become instances of data components, essentially a <i>
		LiveVariable</i> preset to a type.</p>
	<p>
		Data components behave as now in inspector: sub-objects are shown in the 
		inspector-tree, fields are shown in the inspector proper for the seleted 
		data-object or sub-object.</p>
	<p>
		Each sub-object has a boolean <i>fetch</i> property which can be 
		checked to (suggest) eager loading of that object.</p>
	<p>
		Fields can be dragged off the inspector itself and placed on the canvas to 
		produce an appropriate editor.</p>
	<p>
		Each data-object or sub-object has a virtual <i>form</i> property which can be 
		dragged off and placed on the canvas to produce a Form for this object (a group 
		box auto-populated with editors).</p>
	<p>
		Each data-object or sub-object has a virtual <i>grid</i> property which can be 
		dragged off and placed on the canvas to produce a Grid for this object.</p>
	<p>
		There is an <i>Operation</i> component which can be associated with <i>one or 
		more</i> Data components to perform batch operations.</p>
	<p>
		There are <i>NavigationBar</i> (first, previous, next, last) and <i>OperationBar</i> 
		(New, Save, Cancel toolbar) widgets that can be placed anywhere and associated 
		with <i>one or more </i>Data components<i>.</i></p>
