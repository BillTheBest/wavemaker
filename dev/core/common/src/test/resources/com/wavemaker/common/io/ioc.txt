The interface org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext represents the Spring IoC container and is responsible for instantiating, configuring,
and assembling the aforementioned beans. The container gets its instructions on what objects to instantiate, configure, and assemble by reading
configuration metadata. The configuration metadata is represented in XML, Java annotations, or Java code. 
It allows you to express the objects that compose your application and the rich interdependencies between such objects.
