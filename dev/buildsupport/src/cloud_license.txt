5.  	Proprietary Information

5.1	Definition.  As used in this Agreement, “Proprietary Information” means all information disclosed by Licensor to Licensee, before or after the date of this Agreement, and generally not publicly known, whether tangible or intangible and in whatever form or medium provided, as well as any information generated by Licensee to the extent that it contains, reflects, or is derived from Proprietary Information.  Proprietary Information of Licensor includes, without limitation, the Licensed Materials.  The terms and conditions of this Agreement are Proprietary Information; however, the existence of this Agreement is not Proprietary Information.

5.2	Protection of Proprietary Information.  Licensee shall hold the Proprietary Information, including without limitation the Licensed Materials, in strict confidence.  Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, Proprietary Information may not be copied, reproduced, or distributed, and Licensee shall not sell, lease, license, assign, transfer, or disclose the Proprietary Information to any third party.  Licensee shall protect Proprietary Information by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, as it uses to safeguard its own confidential or proprietary information of a like nature from unauthorized use, disclosure, or dissemination, including, without limitation, securing all servers, drives or media on which the Software is installed or maintained.  Licensee agrees to restrict access to Proprietary Information to only its employees who require such access in the course of their assigned duties and responsibilities and who have been informed of Licensee’s obligations of confidence and have agreed in writing to preserve the confidentiality of such information under terms and conditions no less restrictive than those set forth in this Agreement.  Licensee shall enforce all such obligations.  In the event that any Proprietary Information is expressly required to be disclosed pursuant to any law, code or regulation, Licensee shall give Licensor immediate notice of such requirement and shall use its best efforts to seek or to cooperate with Licensor in seeking a protective order with respect to such Proprietary Information.

5.3	All Proprietary Information together with all copies of such Proprietary Information, including without limitation copies which Licensee has made, shall remain the property of Licensor.  Upon request, Licensee shall either destroy or return, at the Licensor’s discretion, all Proprietary Information of Licensor and all copies of such Proprietary Information (including without limitation removing any Proprietary Information from Licensee’s servers, drives or media) and certify to Licensor in writing as to such return, destruction and removal.

6.  	WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.  LICENSOR MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED MATERIALS, THE FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OR PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS, OR THE PROFITABILITY OR OTHER BENEFITS TO BE OBTAINED BY LICENSEE FROM THE USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE IN TRADE, REGARDLESS OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING, PROMOTIONAL LITERATURE OR OTHER ACTIONS WHICH MAY GIVE AN IMPRESSION OF CREATING A WARRANTY.

7.  Indemnification by Licensee.  Licensee shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensor from any claim relating to any breach by Licensee of any provision of this Agreement.

8.  	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY (INCLUDING LICENSEE) FOR DAMAGES FOR ANY CAUSE RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARISE FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, HOWEVER ARISING, IN AN AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDS THE TOTAL FEES AND CHARGES PAID BY LICENSEE (WITH RESPECT TO ANY RELEVANT PORTION OF A PARTICULAR PURCHASE SCHEDULE) TO LICENSOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE QUARTERLY PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE EVENT WHICH GAVE RISE TO SUCH DAMAGES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.  LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY (INCLUDING LICENSEE) UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION BASED ON A CONTRACT, WARRANTY, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, HOWEVER ARISING, FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOST PROFITS, INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF BUSINESS, DELAYS, LOSS OF DATA OR PROGRAMS, LOSS OF USE OF COMPUTER HARDWARE, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
