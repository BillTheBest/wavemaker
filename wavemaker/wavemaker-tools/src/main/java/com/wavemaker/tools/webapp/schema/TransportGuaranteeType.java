/**
 * 
 * 
 * The transport-guaranteeType specifies that the communication between client and server should be NONE, INTEGRAL, or
 * CONFIDENTIAL. NONE means that the application does not require any transport guarantees. A value of INTEGRAL means
 * that the application requires that the data sent between the client and server be sent in such a way that it can't be
 * changed in transit. CONFIDENTIAL means that the application requires that the data be transmitted in a fashion that
 * prevents other entities from observing the contents of the transmission. In most cases, the presence of the INTEGRAL
 * or CONFIDENTIAL flag will indicate that the use of SSL is required.
